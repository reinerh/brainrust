BrainRust

A simple Brainfuck interpreter, written in Rust.

Usage:
 $ cargo run filename.bf


Before running the program, it performs a few simple optimizations,
like eliminating commands with no effect (e.g. incrementing and decrementing
a value) and combining sequences of incrementing/decrementing commands
into single commands.

A cell can hold one byte, and will wrap around after it reaches the maximum.
The pointer starts at position 0, but can also become negative.
There is no artificial limitation of the number of cells. Only cells with a value
different than 0 use up memory.
